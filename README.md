# Stochastic optimal transport in the Space of Fourier coefficients

Python codes to implement the numerical experiments from our paper. 
Each notebook corresponds to the figure of the same number from the paper. 

*Example : Figure1.ipynb contains the codes to generate the figure 1*. 

The file "Figures" contains the figures under the EPS format. When running the notebooks, each image is saved automatically in this file.
